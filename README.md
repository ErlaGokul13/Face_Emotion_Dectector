Emojis are frequently used in communication in this digital world to express
emotions and give messages additional context. This system utilizes foreground
extraction and the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network to recognize emotions from
facial expressions in images and retrieve appropriate emojis to represent those emotions.
The system employs the VGG16 model for picture classification and the GrabCut
technique for foreground extraction. The dataset includes facial photos with six
fundamental emotions and one neutral category and is used to train the system.
